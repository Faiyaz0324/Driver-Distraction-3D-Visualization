# Driver-Distraction-3D-Visualization
This project analyzes survey data on driver distraction factors and visualizes patterns across demographic groups using 3D surface plots. The aim is to understand how distractions such as music, phone calls, texting, eating, or passengers affect drivers differently by age, gender, or occupation.
